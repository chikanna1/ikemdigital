          <h2>Custom Design</h2>
          <p class="py-2">
            All of our work is 100% custom. Designed for you in Figma. We never
            use pre-made templates. Ever.
            <br />
            <br />
            We start with a Website Questionnaire, where we learn more about
            you, your company and customers. You will share other websites you
            like the look and feel of along with any fonts, colors or any other
            design directions you have. We will then create a fully custom
            design, for free, based on your specifications.
            <br />
            <br />
            Once we start working together you can take the design in any
            direction you would like. You will have plenty of rounds of revision
            to get the design exactly as you need.

          <h2>Custom Wordpress Development</h2>
          <p class="py-2">
            We specialize in designing and developing custom WordPress websites.
            <br />
            <br />
            What this means is that not only is the design custom but the
            backend development is as well. Our sites are developed to require
            no technical knowledge to edit and update.
            <br />
            <br />
            You will be able to hand over the website to anyone within your
            organization and they will be able to easily update and edit the
            site. If you can update your Facebook profile you will be able to
            update this site.

          <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
          <p class="py-2">
            We provide on-page Search Engine Optimization as part of our
            services. This means getting your site to rank well on Google to get
            free traffic.
            <br />
            <br />
            Many people like to talk about SEO (Search Engine Optimization) but
            we can actually prove that we know what we’re doing. If you Google
            ‘San Francisco Web Design’ or ‘Hire a Web Designer’ we’re the number
            #1 result.

          <h2>Personalized Project Management</h2>
          <p class="py-2">
            You will have a dedicated project manager who will take ownership of
            your project until its completion.
            <br />
            <br />
            You and your project manager will be in constant communication via
            email. You will also collaborate with your project manager via Zoom
            meetings to provide feedback on the design.

          <h2>Why Us?</h2>
          <p class="py-2">
            Our projects are priced on a flat fee basis. We hate it when
            projects go over budget as much as you do, that’s why over 95% of
            projects stay on budget.
            <br />
            <br />
            But don’t just take our word for it. Check out our 50+ Five Star
            reviews on places like Google Reviews and Yelp. We’ve been in
            business for over 10 years and have no negative reviews to show for
            it. The reason is, we really care about our clients and their
            experience with us.
